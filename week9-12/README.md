Business Problem
The primary goal is to mitigate the inherent risks and uncertainties in stock market investments by predicting future stock prices. Accurate predictions can significantly enhance investment strategies, leading to better risk management and increased investment returns. This problem addresses the need for advanced analytical tools in the investment world, where traditional methods often fall short in accurately predicting market movements.

Background/History

The advent of data science and machine learning offers new avenues for predictive modeling, providing the potential for more accurate and timely predictions based on historical data.
